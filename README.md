# Files-on-Disk
This program provides information about specified directory sizes (or rather combined size of all the files stored in an indicated directory) along with a list of its largest files.

To run, the program expects two command line arguments.
First, the name of the directory on your disk to explore, 
and second, an optional argument that can be used to indicate 
how many files should be displayed in the list of largest files 
(the default value is 20).
